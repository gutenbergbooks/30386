THE MANY</span></h1>

<h2>By Milton Lesser</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There are</span> some who tell me
it is a foolish war we fight. My
brother told me that, for one, back
in the Sunset Country. But then, my
brother is lame and good for nothing
but drawing pictures of the
stars. He connects them with lines,
like a child's puzzle, and so makes
star-pictures. He has fish stars,
archer stars, hunter stars. That, I
would say, is what is foolish.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is what started it
all. I was looking at the stars, trying
to see the pictures, when I should
have been minding my sentry post.
They took me like a baby, like a tot
not yet given to the wearing of
clothing. The hand came out of the
darkness and clamped over my
mouth, and I ceased my struggling
when I felt a sharp blade pricking
at the small of my back.</p>

<p>At first I feared that they would
slay the entire camp as it slept and
I cursed my brother for his star-pictures,
cursed our leader who had
sent us here, twenty archers, against
the Onist outpost on our country's
border. But the Onists had other
ideas. They took me away. I had to
admire their vitality, because all
night we ran through the silent
woodlands, and they seemed tireless.
I could maintain their pace,
of course: but I'm a Pluralist.</p>

<p>I could see their village from a
long way off, its night fires glowing
in the dark. It was only then that
we slowed our pace. Soon we entered
the place, a roughly circular
area within a stockade, and my captors
thrust me within a hut. I
couldn't do much worrying about
tomorrow, not when I was so tired.
I slept.</p>

<p>I dreamed a stupid dream about
the Onist beliefs, the beliefs of an
unimaginative people who could
picture one Maker and one Maker
only. I must have chuckled in my
sleep.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"You're awake."</span></p>

<p>A brilliant statement, that&mdash;because
I had sat up, squinted into
the bright sunlight streaming in
through the doorway, yawned and
stretched. The Onists, I tell you,
lack imagination.</p>

<p>The girl who spoke was a pretty
enough little thing for an Onist.
She smiled, showing even white
teeth. "Do you Pluralists eat?"</p>

<p>I nodded and rubbed my belly. I
was to have had dinner after my
turn as sentry the night before, and
now I felt like I could do justice to
my portion even at one of the orgies
for which the Onists are so famous.</p>

<p>"Bring on your food and I'll
show you," I told her, and she
turned her back to walk outside. It
was early and the village seemed silent&mdash;surely
they hadn't intended
this one slim maid to guard me! Yet
she seemed alone.</p>

<p>I leaped at her, circled her neck
with my arm, prepared to make my
exit. They would laugh around our
fire when I told them of this fine
example of the Onist lack of foresight....</p>

<p>Except that the girl yelped. Not
loudly, but it was loud enough, and
a big muscular Onist came striding
in with his throwing spear. He
backed me off into a corner, prodding
my hungry belly with his
weapon.</p>

<p>"Will you behave?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;told</span> him I would and he
backed outside, but this time I
could see his shadow across the
doorway.</p>

<p>The girl brought food and partook
of it with me. I was surprised,
because we Pluralists will not eat
with an Onist out of choice. Well,
I have said they are a strange people.
Soon the girl stood up, patting
her mouth daintily with a square of
cloth, and in that, of course, she
was trying to mime our graceful
Pluralist women. "I suppose you
think we are going to kill you," she
said. Just like that.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, I haven't
given it much thought. There isn't
much I can do about it."</p>

<p>"Well, we're not. We could have
done that back at your camp. We
could have killed all of you. No,
we want to show you something."</p>

<p>I had a ridiculous thought that
they made star-pictures, too&mdash;even
those who are not lame like my
brother. I said, "Well, what will
happen to me after you show me?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "You still think we're
going to kill you. What's your
name?"</p>

<p>I told her, but I thought: she
can't even keep a conversation going
without changing the subject.</p>

<p>"Jak," she repeated after me.
"That's a common enough name.
We have Jaks among our Onist
people, you know."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. But you probably
copied it."</p>

<p>"I doubt that. We were here first,
Jak. Our records say so. Probably,
you once captured a man with that
name, long ago, liked it, and took it
for your people."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> were here first!" I sneered.
"Maybe that's what your records
tell you, but it isn't so. Look: the
Makers endowed us with life, then
went away in to the sky. By mistake
they left one idiot-Maker behind,
and he had nothing to do. He made
you Onists before he perished, and
that is why you think there is only
one Maker."</p>

<p>She seemed highly insulted.
"Idiot-Maker? Idiot! There was
only one Maker, ever, but because
your minds cannot conceive of all
that glory residing in one figure,
you invented a score."</p>

<p>Now it was my turn to be indignant.
"A score? Hundreds, you
mean; thousands&mdash;more than there
are leaves on the trees."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't argue with you.
Our war has been arguing that
point well enough." I was sorry she
would not argue. She looked very
pretty when she argued, her breasts
heaving, her eyes sparkling fire.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nari. My name is Nari. And
don't tell me you had that name
first!"</p>

<p>I smiled blandly. "Of course we
did. I have an aunt, my mother's
sister, who goes by that name. My
brother's wife's cousin, also; but she
is very ugly."</p>

<p>"And am I ugly?" Nari wanted
to know. I guess in that sense at
least, women are the same everywhere&mdash;Pluralist
or Onist, it doesn't
matter.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;looked</span> at her. I looked at her
so hard that it made her blush,
and then she looked even prettier.
But I didn't tell her so.</p>

<p>"You will pass, for an Onist," I
admitted. "I guess the Onists might
consider you pretty; the Onist men
might stamp their feet and shout if
you go by&mdash;but then, they are Onists."</p>

<p>At that, she seemed on the verge
of leaving my prison hut, but something
made her change her mind.
She stayed all morning and on into
the afternoon. We argued all the
time, except at midday, when she
went outside to get our lunch. She
stumbled a little and fell half
against my shoulder. I moved toward
her to hold her up, and it was
the most natural thing in the world
to take her in my arms and kiss her.
She must have thought so, too; she
responded beautifully&mdash;for an Onist.</p>

<p>After lunch, Nari did not mention
the kiss, nor did I. It now
seemed the most natural thing in
the world not to talk about it. We
argued some more, Nari defending
her primitive beliefs, I trying to
show her the light of truth. But it
was no use: the war had been
fought and the war would continue.</p>

<p>Later that day we set out. That
came as a surprise to me, because
I had taken it for granted that
whatever the Onists wanted to
show me was right here in this little
village. A dozen of us went, and
when we had been on the trail for
some little time, Nari joined us, declaring
that she wanted to see it
again&mdash;whatever it was.</p>

<p>We went for three days, and although
these Onists turned out to
be better woodsmen than I had
thought, still, they could not match
the skill we Pluralists have mastered
over the generations. I believe I
could have escaped, had I wanted
to; but I hardly seemed a prisoner
of war, and besides, once or twice
when we had lagged to the rear of
the column, Nari stumbled against
me like that day in the hut, and
what could I do but kiss her?</p>

<p>It was another village we reached
at the end of our march, much bigger
than the first. Surprisingly, it
looked a lot like a Pluralist town,
although it may only have seemed
so because I had been out in the
woodlands for three days. They
took me straightways to the village
square, and it was there that I saw
the statue.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">These statues</span> of the Makers are
rare, and I was surprised to see
one in an Onist village. I got on my
knees at once to do it reverence. I
realize it was impious to look up,
but I did&mdash;I had to see if it were
the genuine thing. And it was, to
the last detail. Constructed of the
forbidden substance known as
metal, it towered three times a
Pluralist's height, or three times an
Onist's, for that matter. I have always
wondered why the Makers did
not create our ancestors in their
own substance, as they had fashioned
us in their image. But that is an
impious thought.</p>

<p>A stern gray-haired Onist who
said he was Nari's father took me
aside afterwards. "Now, Jak," he
asked me, "what can you say of
what you have seen?"</p>

<p>I shrugged. "I can say that somehow
you've found one of the Maker
statues. What more?"</p>

<p>"It's one, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Of course it's one. They are
rare, but I have seen three, all told,
in Pluralist villages."</p>

<p>"And each time they were separate?
You never saw a group?"</p>

<p>"No. No, I didn't."</p>

<p>He slapped his hands together
triumphantly. "Then that proves it.
Each is a copy of the original Maker,
but there was only one. Otherwise
you would have seen statues
in groups. And that is why you are
here, Jak: we want you to go back
to your people and tell them what
you saw."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "What you say
isn't logical. So what if the statues
are never in pairs or groups? We've
only seen a few, when once there
must have been many. Also, when
your artists do their magic with
dyes and create portraits, are they
generally done one at a time or in
groups?"</p>

<p>"One at a time, so the artist may
capture the personality in each face,
naturally. I have seen group portraits,
but I think they are silly
things."</p>

<p>"Exactly." Now I was triumphant.
"Exactly as the Makers
thought, which is why the statues
are always single&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it is impious to say there
was more than one Maker! He had
all the knowledge in the world at
his fingertips, and so there was no
need for more than one. More than
this world, even: he went to the
stars. Or don't you believe that?"</p>

<p>"Of course I believe it. Only,
<i>they</i> went to the stars, the thousands
of Makers. It isn't impious,
because if you can think of one being
as great as that, try to picture
thousands. Yes, thousands. That
makes me thousands of times more
pious than you Onists."</p>

<p>He shook his head wearily.
"What's the use? It is for this we
are fighting our war, and we
thought if we took one of you here,
showed him the undeniable truth of
our statue.... Well, will you at
least return to your people with a
tale of what you have seen?"</p>

<p>I agreed readily enough: probably,
the alternative was death. Although
Pluralists on rare occasions
have been known to take Onist
women as their wives, an Onist
prisoner of war was an unwanted
thing. The reverse would also be
true.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They all</span> bid me goodbye, except
for Nari. I could not find her
anywhere in the village, and a little
sadly I set out on my long journey
back to the Sunset Land. By now
our raiding party had finished its
work on the small Onist village on
the rim of our country, and I could
do nothing but return to my people,
where we might plan new strategy
against the unbelievers.</p>

<p>But I had wanted to bid Nari
farewell.</p>

<p>I met her in the woodlands, a
travel bag slung over her shoulder
like a male's. "I wanted to say
goodbye privately," she told me.</p>

<p>"Good," I said, but I knew she
was lying. Else why the travel bag?</p>

<p>"Goodbye," Nari whispered, but
she was not looking at me. Looking,
instead, behind her, at the land of
her people.</p>

<p>"Nari," I told her, "I have to
admit it. You are very pretty&mdash;even
by Pluralist standards. You are&mdash;"</p>

<p>This time she did not stumble
against me. It wasn't necessary. I
drew her to me, and I kissed her a
long kiss. Then I told her I loved
her, and women, I suppose, will always
be women, because she said
she knew it.</p>

<p>I will take Nari back to our village
in the Sunset Land, where we
will be married by the laws of my
people. And if ever there is to be
peace between the Pluralists and
the Onists, it may, after all, come
on these grounds. The Onists have
their beliefs, and so I hate them
for their impious thoughts. But the
love of a man for a maid exists
apart from that.</p>

<p>It won't be easy. Our arguing
continued all the way back to the
Sunset Land, and Nari is as stubborn
as I am firm.</p>

<p>"There is one Maker," she said.</p>

<p>And I told her, "No, there are
many."</p>

<p>Or later, as we neared the Sunset
Land, we picked up the thread of
our thoughts again. Pluralist or
Onist, we androids are dogmatic
creatures.</p>

<p>"One Robot created us all before
he went to the stars," said Nari.</p>

<p>"Robots," I said. "Many Robots."
But I kissed her.</p>
